# PredictiveOps â€” AWS Outage Early-Warning System

PredictiveOps is an AWS-native early-warning system that collects CloudWatch, Route53 resolver logs,
and DevOps Guru insights, correlates them via a Lambda "predictive-correlator", and sends real-time SNS alerts.
Includes docs and an architectural whitepaper.
